Task 2: Findings on Wikipedia's HTML Source Code

1. Metadata
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding (UTF-8) for the webpage, ensuring compatibility with various languages.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Makes the webpage responsive by adapting its layout based on screen size.
<meta name="description" content="Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia...">: Provides a brief description of the page for search engines.
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">: Sets the browser’s theme color when displaying the page.

2. Headings and Semantic Elements
<h1>: Used for the main title, “Welcome to Wikipedia.”
<h2>: Used for subheadings like "The Free Encyclopedia."
Semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, and <nav> organize the content, improving accessibility and readability.

3. Multimedia
<img>: Various images, such as the Wikipedia globe logo, include proper alt attributes for accessibility.
No <video> or <audio> elements were present, as the homepage focuses on text-based information.

4. Security-Relevant Tags
Content Security Policy (CSP):
Present in HTTP headers to restrict sources for scripts, styles, and other content, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Sandboxed Iframes:
Some embedded components use the sandbox attribute to limit their functionality and reduce risks.
HTTPS:
All resources are loaded securely using HTTPS.

5. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS headers were identified, enabling Wikipedia to load resources (like fonts) from external servers while ensuring secure cross-origin requests.

6. Subresource Integrity (SRI)
SRI attributes, such as integrity in <script> tags, were present. These ensure that external resources, such as JavaScript files, are not tampered with during delivery.
